          <span class="legend-intro"></span> Since their incorporation in 1939, Black Warrior Electric Member Corporation has systematically oppressed the west Alabama community. While technically a cooperative, they opperate like a private company and have targeted poor families by keeping them economically suppressed and politically intimidated. REC Democracy Project is an organizing campaign to democratize the Black Warrior EMC. Part of their campaign is to make data more visible through mapping.

          This map shows the portion of income that the poorest households (people making less than 50% of the federal poverty level) spend on energy. Low-income households have a disproportionate energy burden.
